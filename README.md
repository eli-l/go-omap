# Ordered Map for Go (Golang)

This library uses an experimental feature for iterators.

You need to enable `GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc` in order to build it.

## Ordered map
Provides a way to use Key-Value pais within a map (strictly typed with generic functions).
at the same time it keeps the order of the keys within the internal slice.
